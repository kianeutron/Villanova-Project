        MeetUp and Girls Gone International. These groups and many others like
        them bring together all international people living in a city away from
        home and will give you a wider spectrum of international friendship
        outside of student life. You can choose to join events created by other
        people- such as hiking trips, creative activities, or even pub nights,
        and you can even create your own!

      students in the University’s six colleges: the College of Liberal Arts and
      Sciences, the Villanova School of Business, the College of Engineering,
      the M. Louise Fitzpatrick College of Nursing, the Villanova University
      Charles Widger School of Law and the College of Professional Studies. As
